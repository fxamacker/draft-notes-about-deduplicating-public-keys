TODO: Change "we" to the name of the system in the blog after checking if this text is acceptable. Round the results like 28.8 GB after updating them (migrate a newer mainnet snapshot before the blog and run extra tests again while newer stats are being extracted).

## How We Cut 210M Cryptographic Hashes With Account Key Deduplication

By optimizing how we store account keys, we reduced execution state size by 28.8 GB, 7.2 percent of the entire execution state. Perhaps more importantly, we did this by immediately reducing the total number of payloads, and while at it we also reduced the rate of growth for the ever-growing payload count.

To put what we achieved into perspective, we found 77.6 million payloads with duplicate keys, but we reduced the number of payloads by 86.1 million without using compression (not a typo)! We beat the best case scenario in the area that matters.

Reducing payload count matters because each payload can add different overhead (cpu, ram, disk, network) to different types of servers running databases, caches, execution state, indexers, etc. that handle payloads in various ways.

As one example, MTrie (the execution state), uses 2-3 trie vertices (192-288 bytes) for each payload, and that overhead is larger than the 72-78 byte payload sizes for account keys. We eliminated over 210 million Mtrie vertices containing cryptographic hashes we don't need anymore, by reducing the number of payloads by 86.1 million.

Reducing payload counts and their overhead helps reduce hardware costs and energy consumption on servers that handle payloads. Memory use reduction on AN, EN, etc. are hard to measure since we are deploying unrelated projects at the same time, but we know we are loading 28.8 GB less execution state into RAM on EN and memory usage reduction in a prior project was reported to be a multiple of the state size reduction.

At the same time, the change does not take anything away from end users. Multi-key accounts remain as flexible as before, and applications that rely on duplicate keys for managing multiple in-flight transactions continue to work exactly as expected.

### MY NOTES

From the "Results" section of the README (also DRAFT) at:
- https://github.com/fxamacker/draft-notes-about-deduplicating-public-keys

NOTE: The new data format is designed to reduce payload count by more than the total number of duplicate keys.

There are ~77.6 million duplicate payloads and migration reduces payload count by 86.1 million payloads (not a typo).

Most accounts on mainnet only have 1 account key but they still use fewer bytes in the new data format.

MTrie is the in-memory data structure containing the execution state. MTrie has vertices and payloads (atree and non-atree payloads).

This project only modifies non-atree payloads (account status and public key payloads).

Checkpoint files use a more space-efficient but slower encoding format to save MTrie to disk priodically, so checkpoints are smaller than MTrie.

If the Execution Nodes (Servers) RAM usage are reduced by less than the reduction in MTrie size, then it is likely that unrelated changes or activity is consuming extra RAM (vm configuration, OS page cache, db memory mapped files, updated components, etc.).  For example, some types of garbage collectors and databases might hold on to more RAM (to improve performance) if they detect more free RAM is available.
